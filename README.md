# Wraith King Arcana Tracker

I made this to keep track of the arcana progress for Wriath King (and to learn a little Ruby along the way).
The Dota UI to keep track of the remaining heroes needed to collect is pretty useless.

How to use:
```
// Puts all uncollected heroes
ruby wk.rb

// Puts all collected heroes
ruby wk.rb collected

// Resets all collected heroes
ruby wk.rb reset

// Searches for an uncollected hero and prompts for collection
ruby wk.rb {hero}
```
